# book_search_engine


## Description
  
My goal for this project was to create a full stack book_search_engine, using a React front end, with a Node backend, using a MongoDB Database with a GraphQL API server.  I hoped to learn more about GraphQL queries and mutations.  I also hoped to learn more about React context, and Redux style implementations.
